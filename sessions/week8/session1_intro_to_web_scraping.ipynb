  {"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["### 🔄 JavaScript Transition Note\n","\n","If you're coming from JavaScript/web development, you're probably familiar with the Fetch API or axios for making HTTP requests, and libraries like Cheerio or built-in DOM methods for HTML parsing. Python's urllib provides similar functionality to fetch(), but with a more traditional callback-style API. The html.parser works similarly to DOM parsing, but with a different event-driven approach using handle_starttag() and other methods instead of query selectors. Both approaches achieve the same goal: extracting data from HTML documents."]},

Python's matplotlib serves a similar purpose but with a different API. The key difference is that matplotlib creates static images, while JavaScript libraries often create interactive web-based charts. However, the fundamental principles of choosing the right chart type and presenting data clearly remain the same across both ecosystems."]},

Python's sqlite3 module provides similar functionality to better-sqlite3 or other Node.js SQLite libraries. The key concepts remain the same: use parameterized queries to prevent injection attacks, manage connections properly, and handle transactions. The main difference is Python's more traditional API versus JavaScript's Promise-based or async/await patterns."]},
